Algorithms with C++
====================

# algorithm learning
  * algorithm learning and implementation in C++
  * All problems are from leetcode . And all the solutions are AC on leetcode.
  * Some problems are solved with one-more solutions

## array and string 
  * This category contains problems related with array and string operation

## math
  * Problems in this class will need some math skills such as logical opertion and bit 

## link list
  * mainly use linked list to solve the problem. 
  * the key point in linked list problem is to record or find the pre and post list node where you will perform the disjoint or joint operation

## dynamic programming
  * problems that can be solved with dynamic programming

## tree
  * take advantage of binary search tree , red-black tree, etc.
  * implement abstract tree structure

## greedy
  * solve problems using greedy method

## stack queue
  * implement data structure
  * using stack/queue to solve problems
