# 问题描述

首先，*Leetcode*上有一道题:

> Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen. 
  * Follow up:
    What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

这道题很好的引出了一个问题，那就是如何从一个很大的集合或者大小不确定的集合中随机的选择*k*个样本。
